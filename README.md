### lab 2 main.c (Basic IO)
Implement a program that simulates a sensor node measuring the outdoor temperature. Use the pseudo-random number generator to simulate temperature readings and use the sleep function (read man pages!) to generate temperature readings at a pre-defined frequency. The temperature values should be realistic outdoor values (not too cold, too hot – e.g. between -10 and +35°C). Use #define's to set the frequency, min. and max. temperature values.
